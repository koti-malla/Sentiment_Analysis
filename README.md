### 1. What is BERT?
BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a game-changer in the realm of NLP. Developed by Google, BERT is all about understanding the context of words in a sentence—something that previous models struggled with.

Let's break it down:

Bidirectional: BERT reads text both forward and backward. This allows it to understand context from both ends of the sentence, not just from left to right or right to left.

Encoder Representations: BERT uses encoders to transform words into numerical vectors that machines can understand. This is how it deciphers the context of words.

Transformers: A type of model that uses self-attention mechanisms, meaning it pays attention to all the words in the sentence when understanding the context of a particular word.

In simpler terms, BERT is essentially a language detective. It doesn't just look at words—it delves into the hidden depths of language to understand the meaning behind words based on their context.
